# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)
The set up of this project is perfect for this being Sprint 2 but eventually, I would like to make it more expanded. By expanding it, I mean instead of using the form to book a table, I would use it to place orders ahead of time. I don't know many coffee places that accept reservations but placing orders through a website or app is becoming more common today.
